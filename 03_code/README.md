This repository contains the analysis workflow for the manuscript entitled "Chromosomal genome assembly resolves drug resistance loci in the parasitic nematode *Teladorsagia circumcincta*"

Abstract: "The parasitic nematode *Teladorsagia circumcincta* is one of the most important pathogens of sheep and goat farming in temperate climates worldwide and can rapidly evolve resistance to drugs used to control it. To understand the genetics of drug resistance, we have generated a highly contiguous genome assembly for the UK T. circumcincta isolate MTci2. Assembly using PacBio long-reads and Hi-C long-molecule scaffolding together with manual curation resulted in a 573 Mb assembly (N50 = 84 Mb, n = 1,286) with five autosomal and one sex-linked chromosomal-scale scaffolds consistent with its karyotype. The genome resource was further improved via annotation and, with manual curation of over 3,200 genes, resulted in a robust and near complete resource (96.3% complete protein BUSCOs) to support basic and applied research on this important veterinary pathogen. Genome-wide analyses of drug resistance using three distinct experimental frameworks identified evidence of selection around known candidate genes for benzimidazole, levamisole, and ivermectin resistance, as well as novel regions associated with ivermectin and moxidectin resistance. These insights into contemporary and historic genetic selection further emphasise the importance of contiguous genome assemblies in interpreting genome-wide genetic variation associated with drug resistance and prioritising key loci for developing diagnostic markers to support parasite control.

Note: while much effort is made to make all data and code available, some of the code is very specific to the Sanger HPC environment and will need to be modified to work elsewhere. If you are interested in using any of it for your own work, but are stuck, please do get in touch.
